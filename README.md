# Black Hole Simulation
Python code used for the [ForMe](https://www.liceocassini.it/pages/forme.php) festival workshop hosted by me and fellow student [Giulia Aurora Prato](https://github.com/Giulia-aurora).
It is a basic black hole simulation animated with PyGame (yeah no I know it's not a good idea, but I thought it would be easier to understand for everyone).

It should be noted that I also was the main developer for the [ForMe 2023 Website](https://github.com/lorenzo-frittoli/forme-website).
